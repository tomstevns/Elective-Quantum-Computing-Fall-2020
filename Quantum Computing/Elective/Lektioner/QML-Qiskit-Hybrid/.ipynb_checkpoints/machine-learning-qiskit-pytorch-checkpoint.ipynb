    "Machine learning (ML) has established itself as a successful interdisciplinary field which seeks to mathematically extract generalizable information from data. Throwing in quantum computing gives rise to interesting areas of research which seek to leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to augment machine learning or vice-versa. Whether you're aiming to enhance classical ML algorithms by outsourcing difficult calculations to a quantum computer or optimise quantum algorithms using classical ML architectures - both fall under the diverse umbrella of quantum machine learning (QML).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we explore how a classical neural network can be partially quantized to create a hybrid quantum-classical neural network. We will code up a simple example that integrates **Qiskit** with a state-of-the-art open-source software package - **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)**. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the ease of integrating Qiskit with existing ML tools and to encourage ML practitioners to explore what is possible with quantum computing.\n",

    "### 1.1 Preliminaries <a id='prelims'></a>\n",
    "The background presented here on classical neural networks is included to establish relevant ideas and shared terminology; however, it is still extremely high-level. __If you'd like to dive one step deeper into classical neural networks, see the well made video series by youtuber__ [3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk). Alternatively, if you are already familiar with classical networks, you can [skip to the next section](#quantumlayer).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Neurons and Weights\n",
    "A neural network is ultimately just an elaborate function that is built by composing smaller building blocks called neurons. A ***neuron*** is typically a simple, easy-to-compute, and nonlinear function that maps one or more inputs to a single real number. The single output of a neuron is typically copied and fed as input into other neurons. Graphically, we represent neurons as nodes in a graph and we draw directed edges between nodes to indicate how the output of one neuron will be used as input to other neurons. It's also important to note that each edge in our graph is often associated with a scalar-value called a [***weight***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network#Connections_and_weights). The idea here is that each of the inputs to a neuron will be multiplied by a different scalar before being collected and processed into a single value. The objective when training a neural network consists primarily of choosing our weights such that the network behaves in a particular way. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Feed Forward Neural Networks\n",
    "It is also worth noting that the particular type of neural network we will concern ourselves with is called a **[feed-forward neural network (FFNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network)**. This means that as data flows through our neural network, it will never return to a neuron it has already visited. Equivalently, you could say that the graph which describes our neural network is a **[directed acyclic graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)**. Furthermore, we will stipulate that neurons within the same layer of our neural network will not have edges between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### IO Structure of Layers\n",
    "The input to a neural network is a classical (real-valued) vector. Each component of the input vector is multiplied by a different weight and fed into a layer of neurons according to the graph structure of the network. After each neuron in the layer has been evaluated, the results are collected into a new vector where the i'th component records the output of the i'th neuron. This new vector can then be treated as an input for a new layer, and so on. We will use the standard term ***hidden layer*** to describe all but the first and last layers of our network.\n"

    "## 2. So How Does Quantum Enter the Picture? <a id='quantumlayer'> </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a quantum-classical neural network, one can implement a hidden layer for our neural network using a parameterized quantum circuit. By \"parameterized quantum circuit\", we mean a quantum circuit where the rotation angles for each gate are specified by the components of a classical input vector. The outputs from our neural network's previous layer will be collected and used as the inputs for our parameterized circuit. The measurement statistics of our quantum circuit can then be collected and used as inputs for the following layer. A simple example is depicted below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"neuralnetworkQC.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\sigma$ is a [nonlinear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) and $h_i$ is the value of neuron $i$ at each hidden layer. $R(h_i)$ represents any rotation gate about an angle equal to $h_i$ and $y$ is the final prediction value generated from the hybrid network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What about backpropagation?\n",
    "If you're familiar with classical ML, you may immediately be wondering *how do we calculate gradients when quantum circuits are involved?* This would be necessary to enlist powerful optimisation techniques such as **[gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)**. It gets a bit technical, but in short, we can view a quantum circuit as a black box and the gradient of this black box with respect to its parameters can be calculated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"quantumgradient.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ represents the parameters of the quantum circuit and $s$ is a macroscopic shift. The gradient is then simply the difference between our quantum circuit evaluated at $\\theta+s$ and $\\theta - s$. Thus, we can systematically differentiate our quantum circuit as part of a larger backpropogation routine. This closed form rule for calculating the gradient of quantum circuit parameters is known as **[the parameter shift rule](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13311.pdf)**. "

The network will need to be compatible in terms of its dimensionality when we insert the quantum layer (i.e. our quantum circuit). Since our quantum  in this example contains 1 parameter, we must ensure the network condenses neurons down to size 1. We create a typical Convolutional Neural Network with two fully-connected layers at the end. The value of the last neuron of the fully-connected layer is fed as the parameter $\\theta$ into our quantum circuit. The circuit measurement then serves as the final prediction for 0 or 1 as provided by a $\\sigma_z$ measurement."

    "In fact, the classical layers of this network train perfectly fine (in fact, better) without the quantum layer. Furthermore, you may have noticed that the quantum layer we trained here **generates no entanglement**, and will, therefore, continue to be classically simulatable as we scale up this particular architecture. This means that if you hope to achieve a quantum advantage using hybrid neural networks, you'll need to start by extending this code to include a more sophisticated quantum layer. \n",
