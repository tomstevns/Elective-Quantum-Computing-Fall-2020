# Elective Quantum Computing (Fall 2020)

A small collection of **Jupyter notebooks** and exercises from an elective course in **quantum computing** (Fall 2020), with a practical focus on building intuition for **single-qubit gates** and basic circuit behavior using **Qiskit**.

> Status: course/exercise notes. Not polished as a standalone “package” — the notebooks are the main artifact.

## Contents

This repository is mostly notebooks such as:

- **Qiskit øvelse – The Double Hadamard (Input Ket zero).ipynb**
- **Y Gates.ipynb**
- **Z-Gate Exercise.ipynb**
- Folder: **Quantum Computing/** (supporting material / additional exercises)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (3.8 is typically fine too)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Qiskit

## Quick start

### 1) Create a virtual environment (recommended)
